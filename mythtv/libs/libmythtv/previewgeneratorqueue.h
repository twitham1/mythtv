 * program main thread. It also implements an API for starting and
 * retrieving information about requests.  This queue is effectively a
 * singleton, although the code does not enforce that.  It is expected
 * that the queue will be created at application startup, and torn
 * down at application shutdown.
 *
 * Preview requestors use tokens to refer to their request.  These
 * have no meaning to the preview generator code, and are mapped to
 * keys which are the used internally for indexing.  Multiple caller
 * tokens can map to the same internal key. (I.E. A preview for a
 * program was requested from two different parts of the code.)
